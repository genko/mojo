mojo is an object language which is influenced by in a lot of ways by
io and smalltalk. I originally started it because I wanted to understand
smalltalk, but I felt squeak a little too weird to spend time in it - I
guess you can call it a pretty serious case of NIH.


Building
========

Just type 'make' to build the 'mojo' executable.

Whirlwind tour of the language
==============================

The language is quite simple : it consists, put simply, of blocks, variable declarations and messages.

# This is a comment

# Assign a value to x:
x := 3;

# Send a message to x:
x + 3;

# Test the value of x, and execute a block it is true
# Note that a block doesn't get parameters, only 
x = 3 ifTrue: [ # doStuff... ]

Hacking
=======

mojo is as simple as possible. I'm not an expert in language implementation, but the interpreter loosely
follows the eval/apply pattern.

Coding conventions
==================

All the names beginning with mojo_ are internal.
