mojo is a smalltalk without smalltalk. That is, without the cruft that smalltalk accumulated 
in 30 years of existence, in the hope that it'd easier to grasp.


Building
========

Just type 'make' to build the 'mojo' executable.

Whirlwind tour of the language
==============================

The language is quite simple : it consists, put simply, of blocks, variable declarations and messages.

# This is a comment

# Declare a variable "x"
System variables add "x"; 

# Assign a value to x:
x := 3;

# Send a message to x:
x + 3;

# Test the value of x, and execute a block it is true

x = 3 ifTrue: [ x y z | # doStuff... ]

Hacking
=======

mojo is as simple as possible. I'm not an expert in language implementation, but the interpreter loosely
follows the eval/apply pattern.

Coding conventions
==================

All the names beginning with mojo_ are internal.
